* The player must then defeat all of the remaining characters to win.
* The player chooses an opponent by clicking on an enemy's picture, who becomes the "defender"
* The player will now continue to click the attack button.
* Whenever the player clicks attack, their character damages the defender. The defender will lose HP( displayed at the bottom of the character's picture)
* The defender will instantly counter the attack. When that happens, the player's character will lose some of their HP.
* The player will keep hitting the attack button in an effort to defeat their opponent. The play's attach power will increase and defender's attach power will remain the same.
